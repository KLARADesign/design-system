# Button

![](../.gitbook/assets/example_button.jpg)

### Principles

* **Identifiable**:  Buttons should indicate that they can trigger an action.
* **Findable**:  Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons.
* **Clear**:  A buttonâ€™s action and state should be clear.

### Usage

Buttons are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

* Dialogs
* Modal windows
* Forms
* Cards
* Toolbars

Buttons should be used in situations where users might need to:

* Submit a form
* Begin a new task
* Trigger a new UI element to appear on the page
* Specify a new or next step in a process
